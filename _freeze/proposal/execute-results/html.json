When writing a research question, please think about the following:\n\n- What is your target population?\n\n- Is the question original?\n\n- Can the question be answered?\n\nFor each data set, include the following:\n\n- A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)\n\n- Statement on why this question is important.\n\n- A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\n- Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\n## Glimpse of data\n\nFor each data set:\n\n- Place the file containing your data in the data folder of the project repo.\n\n- Use the `.head()` and `.info()` functions to provide a glimpse of the data set.\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n",
